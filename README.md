# Whack-A-Mole-Game

I have made a responsive Whack a mole game made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. (Screenshots of webpage below)

![Initial Screen](ss_images/initial_screen.png)

The game has the following features:
1. You can set the amount of time one game should last
2. The mole changes its position randomly every one second

![Screen while playing](ss_images/playing_screen.png)

All the buttons, except for the stop button, are disabled when the game begins so that the game does not crash.
